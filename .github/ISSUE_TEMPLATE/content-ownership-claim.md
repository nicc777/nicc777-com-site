Before claiming content, please note that you cannot claim on behalf of someone else owning content - you must use this facility only to claim content  you believe belongs to you!

# Resource containing the content

URL to the page/resource that contain the content you which to claim: __URL__

# What exactly to you claim

Highlight the exact portion of content under claim - for example a source code snippet or an image.

_Note_: Source code snippets can be hard to claim and in many cases it could be just simply a matter of a common way to solve a very particular problem. However, if you have the same code snippet posted earlier on a public site I will be more than happy to acknowledge it and link to it.

_Note_: Also note that ideas cannot be "owned". This claim is specifically for content - specific test, code snippets, images or other artifacts. You cannot normally claim ownership for the expression of an idea or thought.

# Motivate your claim

* Why do you claim ownership
* Can you prove ownership

# Propose a Remediation

Choose one of the following options:

1. Ask the content to be removed
2. Request acknowledgement and link back to original content
