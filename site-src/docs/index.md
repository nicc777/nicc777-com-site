# About this site

The is [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicocoetzee/) personal site where I like to write and share information about topics close to my heart.

At the moment I have an Information Technology focused [blog](blog/index.md) where I hope to share some of my learnings from working with various technologies. 

In future I will expand my writings on other topics as well.
