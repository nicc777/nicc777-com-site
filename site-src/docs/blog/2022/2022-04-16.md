# Exploring Kubernetes from within Kubernetes... with Python - PART 2

Part 1 is available [here](2022-04-10.md)

Part 1 was a "set the scene" kind of post and in the post I will explore the actual Python solution to gather some basic statistics from within the cluster.

## The goal

The goal for this post is a Python application with a REST API that will print the available CPU and Memory per Node as well as the committed CPU and Memory per Node.

The output data will be in JSON with the following basic structure:

```json
{
    "Nodes": [
        {
            "AKubernetesNodeName": {
                "CPU": {
                    "Capacity": "string",
                    "Allocatable": "string",
                    "Requests": {
                        "Value": 123,
                        "Percent": 123
                    },
                    "Limits": {
                        "Value": 123,
                        "Percent": 123
                    }
                },
                "Memory": {
                    "Capacity": "string",
                    "Allocatable": "string",
                    "Requests": {
                        "Value": 123,
                        "Percent": 123
                    },
                    "Limits": {
                        "Value": 123,
                        "Percent": 123
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
