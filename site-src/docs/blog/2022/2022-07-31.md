# Event Driven Operations - An Example in AWS

A lot has been written about Event Driven Architecture and it is hard to point to a single great resource. Therefore, to save space on my blog (and preventing it from becoming a book), I will just share the following resources for those who would like to familiarize themselves with the concept and theory:

* [What do you mean by “Event-Driven”?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html) by Martin Fowler (2017-02-07)
* [Wikipedia: Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) by various authors ([edit history](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Event-driven_architecture&action=history))
* Various industry takes on the subject:
  * [Red Hat](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/)
  * [AWS](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture) 
  * [MS Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven)
  * [Tibco](https://www.tibco.com/reference-center/what-is-event-driven-architecture)
* [Reference Architecture Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-driven-architecture.html) which also notes that, at least from their perspective, it has been replaced by the [Saga Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)

As you will see, virtually all the resources focus on this pattern from an application perspective. RedHat and AWS hints toward an operational context, but overall I found very little solid references that focus on operational contexts for those of us who have to manage infrastructure, cloud platforms etc.

As we move toward [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac) I think it is worthwhile for DevOps and SRE engineers to also better understand the concept of event driven architecture and patterns, as we also are starting to produce more and more code (and logic). By the way, I specifically link to the Red Hat resource here, as I believe they have a really short but accurate description of the two dominant types of IaC at the moment: declarative and imperative.

What I want to explore in this post is an example of how anyone that has to look after the operations of a platform can leverage the event driven pattern in their operational model. I will focus on AWS, as this is where my experience currently lies - but the principles can very well be applied in any environment.

# Example Scenario

For this specific blog post, I am not too concerned about IaC - I assume it is something that you already do - at least to some extend. If you are not yet on the IaC boat, I would suggest you learn about it as it will change your life! However, your environment, choice of tools etc. will largely dictate if you lean toward a declarative or an imperative IaC strategy. It could even be both! However, since I will be focusing on AWS and use [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) for the examples, you have to keep in mind that this approach is, in my opinion, a little bit of a mix between the two. AWS themselves [will define CloudFormation as declarative](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html) while tools like SAM leans more toward the definition of imperative - even though the final output is CloudFormation templates.

So, without going to deep into these differences any further, I will look at AWS as an example and focus on how we can know that something we defined as IaC changes state - for whatever reason. The idea will be to send a properly formatted notification - standardized to our own specification, to something that can collate all this data. I am not going to propose a solution for how this is finally collected - there are many options and each organization have their own mix. However, the concept and examples up to that point should be fairly portable for AWS users.

In AWS we deploy virtual infrastructure as a service. AWS has hundreds of services, like EC2 (virtual machines), ELB (Application and Network Load Balancers) etc. During a deployment, resources will be created. For example, in the EC2 service, resources like virtual machines, block storage devices, network interfaces etc. are created and all of these resources are required for the resource to work properly.

From a service perspective, each of the resource types in the services can be in different states at different times and in general there are states for a resource being provisioned, then one for it being in a running and stable state and finally a state for when a resource is being de-provisioned (stopped, deleted or whatever other terminology is fitting).

In AWS, when resources changes state, many of such services that the resources belong to can emit an event. This event can be handled by another AWS Service known as the [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). You will see from the service description that the service is really pitched once again at application solutions. However, if you look at the conceptual diagram (copy below), you will clearly see `AWS Services` as an event source:

![AWS EventBridge from DrawIO](../../images/blog_2022_07_31/aws_event_bridge_drawio.png)

The AWS EventBridge can get very involved, but from our perspective we are only interested when a resource in AWS changes state. We want to get informed about it and be able to react to it.

In my example, I will demonstrate how we can get the basic pieces put together to capture AWS service events, transform the even message to a standard form and finally deliver that standardized message in a way that can be consumed by virtually any other third party application.

At this point, it is also important to know which services and resources is capable of producing events. A list of supported services is available [in the AWS documentation for EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html). As can be seen in the diagram above, AWS service events are directed to the default event bus.

In the example scenario we will look at [the EC2 service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html#ec2_event_type) and we see for this service, the following states will produce events:

* `running`
* `shutting-down`
* `stopped`
* `stopping`
* `terminated`

Some of these states are transition states or temporary. In a transition state, the service may sometimes appear to be still operating normally. This depends a lot on the actual service and how it is configured. For example, an EC2 instance in the `shutting-down` state may still have a working SSH service and if you time it right, you may even still be able to log into the instance while in this transitioning state - however short lived your session may be!

# Solution Design

Coming up with an event driven solution can be hard. It takes some time to identify all the various components required and you also have to force yourself to think about potentially other scenarios in which each microservice could be used. The idea is to create services that can operate independently, each reacting to events. 

I probably sneaked in the term `microservice` there, but at the end of each event, the consumer is typically a microservice.

Another consideration is specifically around the environment the solution will be deployed in. In this case, the target is AWS and the example solution will therefore be specifically tailored for this environment.

Therefore, the AWS EventBridge, as already mentioned, is more or less our starting point. The Default Event Bus will receive events that we configure and then we have to do something with that event. The core AWS components at play will be:

* [AWS SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) - A service that can handle a lot of message throughput. A typical pattern is for SNS to send messages to SQS queues or to Lambda Functions directly. The better pattern most of the times is a SNS->SQS->Lambda type pattern. If the Lambda function produces additional messages, these would typically be send to another SNS topic. The reason SNS is popular is that we can use SNS to fan-out messages to multiple destinations. This feature will also be demonstrated in the example.
* [AWS SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html) - A message queueing system which is highly durable. For messages that absolutely has to be processed, those messages should end-up in SQS for other services to consume. Lambda functions can easily consume SQS queued messages. The service has a lot of advanced features, but the example only demonstrates some of the most basic usage scenarios. SQS supports features such as dead letter queues, but these are not in the example.
* [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) - Basically allows you to run code without the need to configure servers. In my opinion, Lambda functions are also ideal as a microservice implementation. In this context, the Lambda function must only provide a single core function, like sending an e-mail message. The function should be able to operate properly on it's own without relying on any other functions. Orchestration of processes that rely on various Lambda functions in order to accomplish a complex task can be done in one of two way: 1) By sending messages via SNS/SQS mechanisms (what the example will utilize); or 2) orchestrated by using [step-functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html). 

A note about SNS Fan-Out: This is a very powerful feature and in our example, we will use it for a hypothetical scenario where the processed event notification is sent to 2x SQS queues: one will be intended for a system based consumption like a monitoring and alerting system which requires the message in a computer readable format, like CSV, while the other queue is intended for message delivery to humans in a more readable format. 

In conclusion, a possible solution could take the following form - which is also the template solution used for our example:

* Note about [AWS SAM templates](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns)

# Implementation

AWS have a fairly large collection of [example SAM templates](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns) in their `serverless patterns` repository. I used these to get started quickly with [my own example repository](https://github.com/nicc777/aws-event-messaging-example) for this exercise.

The specific examples I used included the following:

* [eventbridge-sns](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/eventbridge-sns) example
* [sns-sqs](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/sns-sqs) example
* [sqs-lambda](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/sqs-lambda) example
* [lambda-sns-lambda](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/lambda-sns-lambda-sam-java) example
* [lambda-ses](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/lambda-ses) example
