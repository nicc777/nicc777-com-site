# Event Driven Operations - An Example in AWS

A lot has been written about Event Driven Architecture and it is hard to point to a single great resource. Therefore, to save space on my blog (and preventing it from becoming a book), I will just share the following resources for those who would like to familiarize themselves with the concept and theory:

* [What do you mean by “Event-Driven”?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html) by Martin Fowler (2017-02-07)
* [Wikipedia: Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) by various authors ([edit history](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Event-driven_architecture&action=history))
* Various industry takes on the subject:
  * [Red Hat](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/)
  * [AWS](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture) 
  * [MS Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven)
  * [Tibco](https://www.tibco.com/reference-center/what-is-event-driven-architecture)
* [Reference Architecture Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-driven-architecture.html) which also notes that, at least from their perspective, it has been replaced by the [Saga Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)

As you will see, virtually all the resources focus on this pattern from an application perspective. RedHat and AWS hints toward an operational context, but overall I found very little solid references that focus on operational contexts for those of us who have to manage infrastructure, cloud platforms etc.

As we move toward [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac) I think it is worthwhile for DevOps and SRE engineers to also better understand the concept of event driven architecture and patterns, as we also are starting to produce more and more code (and logic). By the way, I specifically link to the Red Hat resource here, as I believe they have a really short but accurate description of the two dominant types of IaC at the moment: declarative and imperative.

What I want to explore in this post is an example of how anyone that has to look after the operations of a platform can leverage the event driven pattern in their operational model. I will focus on AWS, as this is where my experience currently lies - but the principles can very well be applied in any environment.

# Example Scenario

For this specific blog post, I am not too concerned about IaC - I assume it is something that you already do - at least to some extend. If you are not yet on the IaC boat, I would suggest you learn about it as it will change your life! However, your environment, choice of tools etc. will largely dictate if you lean toward a declarative or an imperative IaC strategy. It could even be both! However, since I will be focusing on AWS and use [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) for the examples, you have to keep in mind that this approach is, in my opinion, a little bit of a mix between the two. AWS themselves [will define CloudFormation as declarative](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html) while tools like SAM leans more toward the definition of imperative - even though the final output is CloudFormation templates.

So, without going to deep into these differences any further, I will look at AWS as an example and focus on how we can know that something we defined as IaC changes state - for whatever reason. The idea will be to send a properly formatted notification - standardized to our own specification, to something that can collate all this data. I am not going to propose a solution for how this is finally collected - there are many options and each organization have their own mix. However, the concept and examples up to that point should be fairly portable for AWS scenarios.

In AWS we deploy virtual infrastructure as a service. AWS has hundreds of services, like EC2 (virtual machines), ELB (Application and Network Load Balancers) etc.

Each of these services can be in different states at different times and in general there are states for a service resource being provisioned, then one for it being in a running and stable state and finally a state for when a resource is being de-provisioned (stopped, deleted or whatever other terminology is fitting).
