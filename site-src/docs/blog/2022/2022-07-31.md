# Event Driven Operations - An Example in AWS

A lot has been written about Event Driven Architecture and it is hard to point to a single great resource. Therefore, to save space on my blog (and preventing it from becoming a book), I will just share the following resources for those who would like to familiarize themselves with the concept and theory:

* [What do you mean by “Event-Driven”?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html) by Martin Fowler (2017-02-07)
* [Wikipedia: Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) by various authors ([edit history](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Event-driven_architecture&action=history))
* Various industry takes on the subject:
  * [Red Hat](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/)
  * [AWS](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture) 
  * [MS Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven)
  * [Tibco](https://www.tibco.com/reference-center/what-is-event-driven-architecture)
* [Reference Architecture Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-driven-architecture.html) which also notes that, at least from their perspective, it has been replaced by the [Saga Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)

As you will see, virtually all the resources focus on this pattern from an application perspective. RedHat and AWS hints toward an operational context, but overall I found very little solid references that focus on operational contexts for those of us who have to manage infrastructure, cloud platforms etc.

As we move toward [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac) I think it is worthwhile for DevOps and SRE engineers to also better understand this concept as we also are starting to produce more and more code (and logic). By the way, I specifically link to the Red Hat resource here, as I believe they have a really short but accurate description of the two dominat types of IaC at the moment: declarative and imperative.

For this specific blog post, I am not too concerned about IaC - I assume it is something that you already do - at least to some extend. If you are not yet on the IaC boat, I would suggest you learn about it as it will change your life!

What I want to explore in this post is an example of how anyone that has to look after the operations of a platform can leverage the event driven pattern in their operational model. I will focus on AWS, as this is where my experience currently lies - but the principles can very well be applied in any environment.
