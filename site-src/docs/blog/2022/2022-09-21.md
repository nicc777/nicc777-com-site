# Productivity and your Hardware

I am not really a hardware person, and for the most part I just use what is available. ANd mostly this is not an issue or something I would even think about.

However, from time to time I discover something that really makes me stop to think that I should have done it a long time ago. 

Today was such a day. Well, technically it was yesterday and some of the text in this post was written on the 20th, but I got tired and finished the post on the 21st... Such is life!

ANyway, back to the life changing hardware I discovered.

It cam in the form of a keyboard...

## Not my first rodeo

Ok, so this is a mechanical keyboard and I did previously own a mechanical keyboard - a Corsair. Unfortunately I can't recall the exact model, as this was about two or three years ago.

I hated that keyboard. It was load and they keys was generally to high for me - in fact the whole keyboard was too high. It would have worked better with one of those arm wrest things, but I'm not a fan of those either. 

So, needless to say, I just thought to myself that mechanical keyboards is just not for me.
