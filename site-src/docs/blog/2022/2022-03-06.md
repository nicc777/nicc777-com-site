# An early start

My day started with another quick security fix:

| Project                                                                            | Update Description                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Java Conversion App (v2 branch)](https://github.com/nicc777/java-conversions-app) | Integrated changes from two PR's from Snyk scans (Security Fixes)         |

A really recommend everyone in the development or DevOps/SRE space to adopt tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) that really helps a lot of keeping your code up to date with the latest security patches.

# Nostalgia Gaming

I managed to get [xpilot-ng](http://xpilot.sourceforge.net/) going on Ubuntu 20.04. I have been playing this game on and off for about 20 years now. In fact, I actually started on the original [xpilot](http://www.xpilot.org/#whatisxpilot) and eventually progressed to the next generation probably about 10 years ago (perhaps it's even further back - can't remember exactly anymore).

This has also got me thinking just how much everything has changed. For example, I also love the [Halo](https://www.xbox.com/nl-NL/games/halo), but these two games are worlds apart. I love the simplicity of xpilot, but I also really enjoy how modern games can really put you into a world almost as real as the physical world.

But things were a lot simpler 20 years ago. Also, the xpilot AI didn't age well. The enemy ships quickly become predictable and easy to defeat. Overall, xpilot is a nice distraction for about 20 to 30 minutes and it does provide some real retro vibes. I hope I can continue to play it for a couple of years more, but the truth is that a lot of these old stale projects will soon become obsolete as compatibility starts to dwindle.

# An interesting through about blog work-in-progress

I also realise that as I prepare the blog entry for the day, it will be possible for those following closely to view some of the updates in GitHub before it is published on the actual website. That is I will sometimes start writing a blog early with one or more commits during the day before publishing.

In fact, I think I am going to adopt this approach to use the blog as something like a journal for the day. Other, more specific topics or technical articles, will have sections of their own - or at least, that's the plan in my head right now. We will see how this plays out.

One consideration I have is to publish more or less at a fixed time every day - perhaps every evening around 18:00 UCT. I guess that will be nice also to get into a routine of regular writing and reflecting.
