# Time Synchronization from Amazon AWS

These days it's easy to take time synchronization for granted. Most new or modern systems comes with time synchronization already installed and configured. Even mobile phones does it automatically when they connect to the cellphone towers.

But how does this work, and what does this announcement from AWS mean?

# How Does Time Synchronization Work?

This can be a very long explanation, but I rather opted for the short version, with sufficient links to more comprehensive resources for those interested in the detail. 

A good starting point is [the wikipedia page on the NTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol).

There are various RFC's, as can be seen by the Wikipedia page, that describe the technical details of the protocol.

Other great resources include "_[How Does NTP Work?](https://sookocheff.com/post/time/how-does-ntp-work/)_" by Kevin Sookocheff and "_[What Is NTP? A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Network Time Protocol](https://www.galsys.co.uk/news/what-is-ntp-a-beginners-guide-to-network-time-protocol/)_" by Ben Telford.

In practical terms, however, it means that for most computer systems they need a Time Server to connect to, and by an implementation of the NTP protocol, the local time service will ensure the computer clock stays as accurate as possible, making micro adjustments throughout as required.
