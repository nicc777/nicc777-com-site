# Kubernetes Persistent Volumes

I have been really busy this month, hence not much materialized in terms of blog posts. Anyway, I have taking a short break and in this time I have experimented further with persistent volumes, using my [previous blog post](2022-05-07.md) as a base.

The ide is to add a persistent volume to a Pod. As a test, I want to use a GlusterFS volume that is also mounted on my local host OS. In theory anything I can see or do in the Pod should also be visible on my local OS mount point.

## K3s Caveats

It should be important to note that K3s is a _lightweight_ Kubernetes distribution and [excludes](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/storage/) certain plugins, like GlusterFS.

If you follow a typical [Kubernetes GlusterFS example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/volumes/glusterfs), you will notice the following output when you run something like `kubectl describe pod/glusterfs`:

```

Since the plugin is not available, the Pod will never start or get into a ready state. I still plan to test the example in another environment at some point in time - perhaps that is also for another blog post... Time will tell.

According to the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/storage/) there are two options:

* Using a local storage provider, or
* Using Longhorn.

There is a nice [Longhorn on K3s for Raspberry Pi](https://rpi4cluster.com/k3s/k3s-storage-setting/) that will be great to follow, but I decided to first try a local storage provider.

## Lab Setup

The lab implementation will be based on K3s exposing persistent volumes using a local storage provider.

# Preparing the cluster for the local storage provider

Before deploying a pod, some preparation work is required. The nest couple of steps will delve into the detail of the preparations of the k3s cluster.

## Installing the local storage provider

To setup the local storage provider, I followed [this README](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) and used the stable build, which was version 0.0.22 at the time of experimenting.

The installation command was run as it was on the README:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/v0.0.22/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml
```

Verify installation with the command `kubectl get all -n local-path-storage`:

```text
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
