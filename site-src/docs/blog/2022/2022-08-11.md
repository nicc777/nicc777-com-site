# AWS HTTP API and Python based Lambda Integration

I have been using AWS API Gateway to AWS Lambda integration for many years, but only recently tried out the deployment with SAM, using the newer HTTP API.

It is surprisingly a lot easier than what it used to be, and in this blog post I hope to give a quick intro into the SAM method of defining and deploying your API. I will also go into a little more detail in the Lambda side as to how to extract POST data as there are several ways in how your Lambda function may receive data.

# Example Project Design

TODO

# SAM Template

TODO

# Lambda Template (Python)

TODO

# Deployment and Testing

TODO

# Where to from here...

This was literally just scratching the surface. API's have a lot of options and some of the other topics you may want (or need to) consider include:

* Authorization
* Using a custom domain
* Stage variables
* Path based variables (and greedy path variables)
* Handling default routes
* Working with OpenAPI 3 definitions (import and export)
* Versioning of your API's
* Managing new deployments, canary deployments and other strategies
