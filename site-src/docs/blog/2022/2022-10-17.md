# Reflection on my current personal project

I have created a personal project to explore and learn about implementing event-driven applications in AWS...

That sounds pretty easy and straight forward, right?

Well, it's just over a month, and of the 11 labs I originally planned, I am still busy with lab 3. Just after a month into this little experiment, I'm pausing a little bit just to reflect on a couple of topics and I thought it may be helpful to others if I share them here as well. ALso, my blog needs a little activity too!

# The basic idea

In my minds eye I had this idea that try to ficus on AWS core services to try and implement an event-driven application. I identified essentially two stacks or paths that I want explore:

* [AWS Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) that is geared toward fast ingestion of many events
* A different approach (and cheaper) that involved AWS S3, SNS, and SQS.

To make things a little more practical, I thought I would create a simulation of a real life application, and I was wondering which type of application would be ideal to experiment with in terms of both the two paths mentioned above. I'm sure a lot of readers would be able to think of something, and I settled on a access card management system. 

My thinking was as follow:

* The more administrative back-office type tasks, like linking a physical access card to an employee I would implement using the S3, SNS and SQS path
* Assuming we have a scenario where a lot of people have to enter/exit a premises at a fairly high rate, I though that might be a good scenario of learning about Kinesis.

Keep in mind, the actual practicality is not that important, but I will still keep it mind to see if the scenarios are at all realistic.

# The "Full Stack"

It turns out I really challenged myself with this one... THere are a number of front-end components required, so in addition to the primary objectives focusing on the event infrastructure and integration, I also plan to look at some web hosting options. I have done basic S3 hosting implementations before (like this blog), so for this exercise I thought I would play with EC2 based hosting, using [AWS FSX](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/) as a common network storage back-end.

With that said, it's probably a good idea to quickly map out all the technologies and services I have touched up to this point as well as those I will probably use soon:

AWS Services:

* S3
* SNS
* SQS
* Kinesis
* CloudWatch
* EC2
* ELastic Load Balancer
* Route 53
* Certificate Manager
* API Gateway
* Lambda
* DynamoDB
* VPC
* Cognito
* SSM (for secure EC2 access)
* Athena (planning to use)

Other technologies:

* Docker, for hosting an Nginx web server on EC2 (could potentially be replaced with ECS? If I still have energy left at the end of the project I would like to explore this)
* Python, for Lambda functions and some other scripts, for example the initial populating of the DynamoDB table
* JavaScript for web development
* Shell scripting for build and deployment logic
* Bootstrap web framework with one of their free templates
