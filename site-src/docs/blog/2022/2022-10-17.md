# Reflection on my current personal project

I have created a personal project to explore and learn about implementing event-driven applications in AWS...

That sounds pretty easy and straight forward, right?

Well, it's just over a month, and of the 11 labs I originally planned, I am still busy with lab 3. Just after a month into this little experiment, I'm pausing a little bit just to reflect on a couple of topics and I thought it may be helpful to others if I share them here as well. ALso, my blog needs a little activity too!

# The basic idea

In my minds eye I had this idea that try to ficus on AWS core services to try and implement an event-driven application. I identified essentially two stacks or paths that I want explore:

* [AWS Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) that is geared toward fast ingestion of many events
* A different approach (and cheaper) that involved AWS S3, SNS, and SQS.

To make things a little more practical, I thought I would create a simulation of a real life application, and I was wondering which type of application would be ideal to experiment with in terms of both the two paths mentioned above. I'm sure a lot of readers would be able to think of something, and I settled on a access card management system. 

My thinking was as follow:

* The more administrative back-office type tasks, like linking a physical access card to an employee I would implement using the S3, SNS and SQS path
* Assuming we have a scenario where a lot of people have to enter/exit a premises at a fairly high rate, I though that might be a good scenario of learning about Kinesis.

Keep in mind, the actual practicality is not that important, but I will still keep it mind to see if the scenarios are at all realistic.

Although the focus is not on security, I do want to implement at least a basic acceptable level of security measures. I believe this is what is missing from many learning projects and security is often left as an after thought and something that should be figured out later. With this exercise I will try to stick with some of the basics as far as possible. I am sure by including the security topic in my focus it will also change the dynamic somewhat, and I am keen to learn how this focus changes things.

# The "Full Stack"

It turns out I really challenged myself with this one... THere are a number of front-end components required, so in addition to the primary objectives focusing on the event infrastructure and integration, I also plan to look at some web hosting options. I have done basic S3 hosting implementations before (like this blog), so for this exercise I thought I would play with EC2 based hosting, using [AWS FSX](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/) as a common network storage back-end.

With that said, it's probably a good idea to quickly map out all the technologies and services I have touched up to this point as well as those I will probably use soon:

AWS Services:

* S3
* SNS
* SQS
* Kinesis
* CloudWatch
* EC2
* ELastic Load Balancer
* Route 53
* Certificate Manager
* API Gateway
* Lambda
* DynamoDB
* VPC
* Cognito
* SSM (for secure EC2 access)
* Athena (planning to use)

Other technologies:

* Docker, for hosting an Nginx web server on EC2 (could potentially be replaced with ECS? If I still have energy left at the end of the project I would like to explore this)
* Python, for Lambda functions and some other scripts, for example the initial populating of the DynamoDB table
* JavaScript for web development
* Shell scripting for build and deployment logic
* Bootstrap web framework with one of their free templates

# Work methodology

This is a one-man exercise, and I am focused on learning. Therefore, there is kind of a plan, which I have laid out in phases I called labs, where each lab focus on a specific outcome. A lot relies on the discovery through practical implementation, so I am not spending a lot of time on planning everything upfront - rather, I allow things to evolve more naturally. So, in terms of planning and design, I basically look ahead no more than about two weeks - and even within that two weeks, things tend to change.

I spend between two and three hours a day during the week and probably a total of around eight to ten hours over weekends on this exercise. Or, about 20 hours a week. That is of course over and above my normal forty-ish hour work week, so it is fairly intense, but focused.

All Infrastructure is deployed via AWS CloudFormation templates and artifacts required for deployment is staged on S3. This allow me to delete the entire project at the end of each session and then re-deploy each day from scratch. To compensate for the wait time during the CLoudFormation actions, I use the time waiting during deployment for planning the session's activities and start to do some actual work as far as possible. At the end of the session, during the deletion of all the stacks, I use the time to reflect, update notes and progress and perhaps also cleanup some bits if required.
