# Tech Nostalgia: Qemu and RedHat Linux 6.2 (circa 2000)

I am really getting to enjoy the retro computing experiments. It takes a lot of time getting things to work, but the whole experience takes me back to the same struggles 20+ years ago. Of course back then it was even more difficult to get your hands on a solution that works. Sometimes it would take days or even weeks since I did not have daily access to the Internet and books or other documentation on hand sometimes only go sofar. But the feeling of satisfaction afterwards when everything is working is just amazing and I think it is that rush that keeps people like me pushing to try the next thing.

This past week I shifted my focus to the server side. I decided on a distribution that really got me into Linux in the first place - RedHat. My very first Linux distribution was RedHat Linux 5.0 and I actually owned an official boxed set.

The floppy discs, by the way, was needed for me as I had a 486 Laptop with a CD-ROM connected via the printer port. The floppy disc contained software to work from a DOS boot-up that would then enable the CD-ROM from where you could then install RedHat. See the video at the end for a typical laptop of the mid 90's and the experience you could expect.
