# Exploring GitPod Configuration and Workflow

In my previous [post](2022-06-07.md) I explored GitPod and I have kinda settled on it as my default Development environment. The last couple of changes in my GitHub repos were all from GitPod workspaces.

The more I use the service the more I like it. My plan is to eventually transition all my development to this service, which provides a VSCode IDE (or InteliJ) in a web browser. I have also used it now a couple of times on my iPad. I created a shortcut on the home screen which also allows the workspace to then run in full screen mode, so it feels just like a real IDE and not a web page.

But the best discovery I have made this far is how powerful the workspace configuration is.
