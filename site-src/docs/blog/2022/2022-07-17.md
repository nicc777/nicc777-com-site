# Tech Nostalgia: Windows 98

I've been hard at work on another [personal project ](https://github.com/nicc777/acfop) using up a lot of time I would usually have for experimenting with various technologies and writing blogs.

However, this weekend I thought I would take a short break from said project and do something a little different. 

I have been trying to get a decent running instance of Windows 9x running for some time, but it seems that the modern virtual machine solutions like VMWare and VirtualBox does not really emulate really old hardware very well and as a result it is becoming increasingly hard to get really old operating systems running on these solutions. So, I set out to search for something that would emulate the older hardware a lot better. 

Searching for something so niche wasn't something I thought would yield great results - after all, how much of a demand is there for this kind of thing? Turns out, thankfully, I was wrong. There is a rather large and growing group of people into retro computing, and the need for a hardware-accurate emulator seems to have been a common problem this community share.

## PCem

I stumbled on [PCem](https://pcem-emulator.co.uk/) and decided to give it a go. Now, fairly recently (June of 2021) the brain child of PCem, (Sarah Walker) called it quits. But thankfully there is someone (Michael Manley) taking over and it appears my timing was just right as the forums and site was offline for a while.

Anyway, the documentation and instructions is not great and that was a little frustrating. However, I was able to get the application compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 and even got the network going. Below is the commands I used:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential libwxgtk-media3.0-gtk3-dev libopenal-dev libsdl2-dev

./configure --enable-release --enable-networking

make
```

A binary named `pcem` will be created and the first time you run it, it will create a directory `~/.pcem`.

You will need to hunt down roms which are basically the binaries that emulate the old hardware BIOS. Once you have it, you can copy them to the `~/.pcem/roms` directory.

After that whole exercise, setting up a new machine is virtually te same as in any other similar software so if you are familiar with VirtualBox and others, you should be ok. There are also some sites with a more detailed walk through, should you need it.

The configuration is ultimately saved in a file in `~/.pcem/configs`. May final setup consisted of the following:

* Pentium 2 333
* 32 MB RAM
* 2GB Hard Drive
* 3dFX Voodoo 3 3000 Graphics Card
* Sound Blaster Sound
* One floppy drive and one CD Rom drive
* Novell NE2000 Ethernet card

At some point I would love to try getting a dialup emulation going, but for now I just relied on my LAN for connectivity. 

Of course, at this point you will need a lot of original software to setup your system. Luckily I made ISO copies of almost all my old software, but you may also be able to find copies of old software on the Internet - just be aware of copyright as well as the fact that malware is likely to be found on downloaded software.

Anyway, I installed my old copy of Windows 98 with some other software. There was a couple of false starts and only on my third newly created machine was I able to get everything running perfectly.

From the emulator it is possible to take a screenshot, and below is an example from one of my sessions:

At this point the system more or less performed just like I remembered it.

## What worked

All my old software from this era worked great. I was (and still is) a big fan of WordPerfect and Quatro Pro. In my most humble opinion, Corel WordPerfect Suite 8 Professional was (or still is?) one of the best office suites out there. 

I installed some other software but I have not been able to get to it all in detail. However, I have confirmed that these work, and the very short list include:

* Borland Delphi 3 - I did a lot of Windows based development - all freelance - in the 90's on Borland Delphi and this version was one of my favorites.
* Microsoft FrontPage 98 - I created a number of my first web sites with FrontPage. I'm considering using it again for some fun old-school sites
* Netscape Communicator 4 - This was the ultimate in Internet software back in the day.
