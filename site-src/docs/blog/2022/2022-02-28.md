# Moving to CloudFormation

Did a quick CLoudFront distribution this morning just to see how the process works through the AWS Web Console. The basic process includes:

* Creating the SSL certificate in ACM
* Validate the certificate in Route 53 (`CNAME` entry)
* Configure CloudFront:
  * Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
  * Link to the SSL certificate
  * Link to the S3 bucket

There are some finer details, but I need ot do some further reading and experimentation on another domain in order to post the full details. Hoping to do this soon.

Also discovered the [_Restricting access to Amazon S3 content by using an origin access identity (OAI)_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html?icmpid=docs_cf_help_panel) page which I need to spend some time on. I have enabled this feature, but I must admit I don't fully understand the details yet.

Another change I had to make was to make `MkDocs` use the `index.html` pages when ever linking to a directory. This is accomplished by setting the [`use_directory_urls` parameter to `FALSE`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#use_directory_urls).
