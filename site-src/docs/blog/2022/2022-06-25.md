# Thinking about future projects

Just a short entry this time around. I have started working on a personal project that I have been thinking about for some time. It will be an Open Source project and I will be writing about it a lot more once it has reached a level of usefulness. However, in the mean time I'm slowing down my blogging activity to spend more time on this project. The project is already on GitHub and if you are interested in following the progress, you can [follow it here](https://github.com/nicc777/acfop).
