# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Unit Testing Python Code for AWS (Boto3)

The heading is a mouthful, but the approach I want to demonstrate is rather simplistic.

Recently, I was looking at better ways to unit test IaC code I wrote in Python targeting AWS through the excellent [boto3 library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

Although there are several mocking frameworks available in Python, they generally frustrated me as I ended up more time trying to figure out how to conform to the framework than to just get on with the task of testing functionality and moving on.

In this post, I explore a potential testing approach, using the built in [mocking functionality of the Python unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html).


## MVP

The examples below will aim to mock a call to AWS S3 API to see if a particular bucket exists, and if it doesn't, create it. There are therefore potentially two API calls we need to make using the Boto3 Library.

I created a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/nicc777/iac-mocking-test) and all code examples below are from that repository.

As with most Python projects, I recommend using a virtual environment and install boto3. You can do this with the following commands on a Terminal:

```shell
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install boto3
```

Your shell prompt may get an additional label like `(venv)` that indicates you are now in that virtual environment.
