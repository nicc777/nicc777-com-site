# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Unit Testing Python Code for AWS (Boto3)

The heading is a mouthful, but the approach I want to demonstrate is rather simplistic.

Recently, I was looking at better ways to unit test IaC code I wrote in Python targeting AWS through the excellent [boto3 library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

Although there are several mocking frameworks available in Python, they generally frustrated me as I ended up more time trying to figure out how to conform to the framework than to just get on wwith teh task of testing functionality and moving on.

Truth be told, a lot of what I am thinking about can be done in any of the various frameworks, including the built in [mocking functionality of the Python unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html).

However, I am highlighting my approach below and comparing it with standard Python mocking so that you can figure out your own approach.

## MVP

The examples below will aim to mock a call to AWS S3 API to see if a particular bucket exists, and if it doesn't, create it. There are therefore potentially two API calls we need to make using the Boto3 Library.

I created a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/nicc777/iac-mocking-test) and all code examples below are from that repository.
