# Catch all methods in Python classes

[Yesterday blog post](2022-03-07.md) was about unit testing and in my recent ventures in looking at how to mock complex classes with some form of logic to mimic real third party library logic, I came across this feature, which I think is pretty cool.

My initial search led to [this demonstration code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Respond_to_an_unknown_method_call#Python), which also shows/demonstrates how to achieve pretty much the same thing in many other programming languages. 

So how would I use it?

Consider the following class, borrowed (but adapted) from [the project](https://github.com/nicc777/iac-mocking-test) to demonstrate an approach to IaC unit testing discussed yesterday:

```python
class MockS3Client:
    def __init__(self, list_bucket_response: dict=dict()):
        self.list_buckets_response = list_bucket_response
    def list_buckets(self):
        return self.list_buckets_response
    def _bucket_name_exists(self, name: str)->bool:
        for bucket in self.list_buckets_response['Buckets']:
            if name == bucket['Name']:
                return True
        return False
    def create_bucket(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if 'Bucket' in kwargs:
            if self._bucket_name_exists(name=kwargs['Bucket']) is False:
                return {
                    'Location': 'test_location_response'
                }
        raise Exception('Call Failed')
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        def method(*args, **kwargs):
            raise Exception('Method "{}" not yet implemented in unit tests'.format(name))
        return method
```

Below is a sample session in how this class behaves when a call is made to a still unimplemented method:

```python
>>> client = MockS3Client()
>>> client.list_buckets()
{}
>>> client.list_objects(Bucket='test-123')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 20, in method
Exception: Method "list_objects" not yet implemented in unit tests
```

This definitely helps debugging build errors in larger projects.
