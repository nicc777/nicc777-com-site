# AWS Cognito Web App in Pure JavaScript

Back in the early days of the World Wide Web, implementing user authentication was very straight forward. I remember a time where we only used a simple HTML page with a username and password field that was submitted to a CGI application which would check the password against something stored in a database and then issue a cookie. Both [Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) were born out of [Netscape Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape), but it would take a long time before HTTPS was widely adopted. Therefore, in the late 90's and early 2000's the WWW was the Wild West and it is always amazing to me to reflect on just how far we have come.

Today, user authentication is a lot more complex and it is much harder today to properly secure the user authentication process in web applications. Thankfully web frameworks and SDK's have made the process easy, but it still helps to understand the nuts and bolts. This blog post explores the nuts and bolts in the context of what is these days considered a standard flow for authenticating users using a web application: OAUTH2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.

## What is this all about?

In a nutshell:

> This is a detailed walk through with an example web application that will authenticate an already registered and verified user in AWS Cognito in a Web Application using the OAUTH2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE, using pure JavaScript and not relying at all on any AWS SDK's

That was still a mount full, so let's break that down in smaller junks with a little more detail.

The example web implementation I refer to is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/nicc777/aws-cognito-pure-js-example) and all discussions will be referring to this code base, unless otherwise stated.

The idea is to use [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) to authenticate our web users. That means users that register will have their profiles stored in AWS. This is convenient for several reasons:

* AWS, with their [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), takes care of the user pool management and security. All required from the web application is to integrate using the available API's and/or SDK's (the latter is not used, because I wanted to understand the implementation and flow in a more detailed level). 
* The JWT tokens issued by AWS can be used to integrate to other services like [AWS API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html) and [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/authorizationedge-how-to-use-lambdaedge-and-json-web-tokens-to-enhance-web-application-security/) (the links point to some actual integration examples on AWS).
* AWS Cognito provide a host of API functions that can be used, for example there are end-points to obtain user attributes and an endpoint to force a logout (revoking an Access Token).

This blog post and experimental steps are based on an AWS blog post titled _[Understanding Amazon Cognito user pool OAuth 2.0 grants](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/understanding-amazon-cognito-user-pool-oauth-2-0-grants/)_.

For this experiment an AWS Cognito user pool was must exist already with at least one user registered and confirmed. I will not delve into the detail of the steps, but I will share some key configuration decisions that are important.

The web application is a very straight forward HTML and JavaScript application without using any modern frameworks or SDK's. My aim was to go "_raw_" so that I could follow the steps in as much detail as possible. I take this approach whenever I want to really learn the nuts and bolts of something - it's definitely not required, but it does help when things go wrong and then trying to troubleshoot. Understanding the steps involved may at the very least help to pinpoint an issue you may experience when using an SDK with a framework of your choice.

A pure JavaScript implementation in this case means that I did not use any modern framework, but I did end up using some existing JavaScript projects that provided some key function (especially the cryptographic functions) as these are not the easiest thing in the world to implement from scratch and using the existing code is far more effective than trying to copy and paste all the working parts from StackOverflow or something similar. Also note that I am not a particularly proficient JavaScript developer, so the code may not be on any professional level - it simply has enough stuff to get the basic flow working.

_**Important Security Information**_: Based on the previous paragraph, it should therefore be noted at this stage that the code examples is not at all intended for a production environment. In fact, there are some known security issues that I will list below. To follow best practices and secure your application properly, please use the [AWS Amplify JavaScript SDK](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/js/) with your preferred web application framework.

Known Security Issues in this example code base:

* No verification of any of the JWT tokens is done
* The `state` is never validated within the flow
* No specific security measures have been taken to protect any private data
* The refresh token is never used as it was not part of the experiment (I might do a follow up article on this one...)

The experiment implements the [OAUTH2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/). Please note that [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) is an important addition and if you have a web application implementing Authorization Code flow, you really should also be implementing it with PKCE.

## Required Background Knowledge

This project should be ideal for JavaScript or web developers as a means to learn about AWS Cognito integration on a lower level. With that said, some general experience in the following technologies will help:

* HTML
* JavaScript
* AWS (general working knowledge)
* Docker (for running the test)
* The [OAUTH2](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standards

## AWS Cognito Preparations

In order to actually use the code base yourself, You will need to create an AWS Cognito User Pool and define at least one web application.

Configuring the application is the tricky part, but full instructions are [available in the AWS Cognito Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-idp-settings.html).

You will need to configure a "_Public Client_" and most of the defaults should be just fine. 

Add the following _**callback URL**_: `http://localhost:8080/callback.html`

Add the following _**sign-out URL**_: `http://localhost:8080/loggedout.html`

_**Note**_: All callback and sign-out URL's must be HTTPS except `localhost`, which is permitted to ne normal HTTP to allow testing from your local machine.

Include the following scopes:

* `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`
* `email`
* `openid`
* `phone`
* `profile`

The `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin` scope is probably the most important for this test, as it is required to make API calls to the Cognito API for functions such as getting the user's profile (all their attributes) and to sign out a user. All operations for the API [are listed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) but not all these operations can be called with just the access token and the `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin` scope. I found a list of supported operations [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53149091/what-does-the-aws-cognito-signin-user-admin-scope-mean-in-amazon-cognito) and duplicate the list here for convenience:


* [AssociateSoftwareToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateSoftwareToken.html)
* [ChangePassword](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_ChangePassword.html)
* [ConfirmDevice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_ConfirmDevice.html)
* [DeleteUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteUser.html)
* [DeleteUserAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteUserAttributes.html)
* [ForgetDevice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_ForgetDevice.html)
* [GetDevice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GetDevice.html)
* [GetUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html)
* [GetUserAttributeVerificationCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GetUserAttributeVerificationCode.html)
* [GlobalSignOut](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GlobalSignOut.html)
* [ListDevices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_ListDevices.html)
* [SetUserMFAPreference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_SetUserMFAPreference.html)
* [SetUserSettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_SetUserSettings.html)
* [UpdateDeviceStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDeviceStatus.html)
* [UpdateUserAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateUserAttributes.html)
* [VerifySoftwareToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerifySoftwareToken.html)
* [VerifyUserAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerifyUserAttribute.html)

In the sample code, `GetUser` and `GlobalSignOut` will be used.

For this specific test, the following attributes are required and needs to be defined in the setup of the user pool:

* `given_name`
* `family_name`
* `email`

Since you may be running in a sandbox environment for your messaging, you will need to pre-verify your e-mail address (and/or cellphone number).

Finally, pre-register at least one user you can use for testing. The code examples does not include user sign-up examples.
