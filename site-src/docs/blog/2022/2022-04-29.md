# Kubectl Plugins

I must admit - I love tools that can be extended beyond what was initially intended for said tool. The [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) command is such a great example of this!

Extending `kubectl` [has been possible](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/) for some time and the mechanism is rather straight forward. In time, however, it was expected that there will be a number of useful extensions/plugins that many more people would want to use. The challange is that `kubectl` itself never intended to also manage all these extra functionality - it's beyond the scope of it's maintainers and it was up to the community of users to solve this problem.

Enter [`krew`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew), which "_... helps you discover plugins, install and manage them on your machine._".

The [installation instructions](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/) is pretty straight forward and worked without any issues on my Ubuntu system.

After installation, make sure your local index is up to date:

```shell
kubectl krew update
```

It's very similar to `apt` or `brew` or other package managers you may be familiar with.

# Usage Example - Something Familiar

A while back, I demonstrated a [REST API solution](2022/2022-04-16.md) that would provide useful resource capacity information. In that blog post, I showed how you could use `curl` to obtain the data on the command line. 

So for this very quick intro to `krew`, I'm going to solve the same problem, but with a `kubectl` plugin that uses information already available through the standard Kubernetes API: [kube-capacity](https://github.com/robscott/kube-capacity)

There are several ways to search for plugins, for example the command `kubectl krew search resource` may yield the following results:

```text
NAME               DESCRIPTION                                         INSTALLED
resource-capacity  Provides an overview of resource requests, limi...  no
resource-snapshot  Prints a snapshot of nodes, pods and HPAs resou...  no
resource-versions  Print supported API resource versions               no
```

To install `resource-capacity` is as easy as running the following command:

```shell
kubectl krew install resource-capacity
```

The output from the command is just as helpful:

```text
Updated the local copy of plugin index.
Installing plugin: resource-capacity
Installed plugin: resource-capacity
\
 | Use this plugin:
 |      kubectl resource-capacity
 | Documentation:
 |      https://github.com/robscott/kube-capacity
/
WARNING: You installed plugin "resource-capacity" from the krew-index plugin repository.
   These plugins are not audited for security by the Krew maintainers.
   Run them at your own risk.
```

And a quick run of the command `kubectl resource-capacity` immediately yields some useful results:

```text
NODE    CPU REQUESTS   CPU LIMITS    MEMORY REQUESTS   MEMORY LIMITS
*       1950m (32%)    3500m (58%)   1158Mi (4%)       2218Mi (9%)
node1   700m (35%)     1000m (50%)   396Mi (4%)        682Mi (8%)
node2   500m (25%)     1000m (50%)   256Mi (3%)        512Mi (6%)
node3   750m (37%)     1500m (75%)   506Mi (6%)        1024Mi (12%)
```

Compare that with the JSON output from the `pykles` REST service as describe in the earlier blog post:

```json

                    "Percent": 6.358637440444224

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

It's the same output, but only one is really useful for human consumption!
